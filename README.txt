Project Name - Dungeon Escape

This is a text-based game which has been created using C++. 
"An evil sorcerer has captured a group of players and trapped them in a monster-filled, labyrinthine dungeon for his own amusement. " 
"The goal of this game is to make it out of the dungeon with as many party members alive as possible. " 
"Each day in the dungeon makes you more hungry (reduces fullness) and has risks such as monsters and traps. "
"You can fight monsters, speak to NPCs, and explore, but you have to make it through the dungeon "
"before the sorcerer runs out of patience and destroys the dungeon, along with the player and all the party members!"
